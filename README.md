# Getting started:
Fork, then clone this repository and run

    npm install

Inside the repository.

Run:

    npm run dev

This will start your react app.
React app will run on **localhost:3000**.

## Start editing the **src/app.jsx** file.

Add a state variable called "loggedIn", which will be False.
Add a state variable called "username", which will be null at first.

Make it so that our card components are hidden at first, when user opens the website.
Add a login screen to our page. It'll be one div, with the following tags inside of it:
A text input field for our username.
A button called "Log In". 
When the user types in a username and presses the login button, save that username from the input into the "username" state variable. Set "loggedIn" to true.
If "loggedIn" is true, hide the login screen, and show the input and card components from last time.
You can use CSS classes to show or hide the components.
