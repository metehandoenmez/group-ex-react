Modify the existing code to store the "items" array in the browser's localStorage. This way, even if the user refreshes the page, the list of items will persist.


1. In the App component, add a `useEffect` hook to save the "items" array to localStorage whenever it changes. Use the `localStorage.setItem()` method to store the array. The "items" array should be converted to a string using `JSON.stringify()` before storing it.

2. In the App component, add code to retrieve the "items" array from localStorage when the component mounts. Use the `localStorage.getItem()` method to retrieve the stored string and convert it back to an array using `JSON.parse()`. If there are no stored items, initialize the "items" state variable with an empty array.

3. Modify the code in the "Add item" button's click handler to add the new item to the "items" array and update the localStorage. After adding the new item, call `localStorage.setItem()` to store the updated "items" array.

4. Modify the deleteCallback function in the App component to remove the item from the "items" array and update the localStorage. After removing the item, call `localStorage.setItem()` to store the updated "items" array.
