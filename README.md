This will start your react app.
React app will run on **localhost:3000**.

## Start editing the **src/app.jsx** file.

Add an input tag and a button tag to the App component.

In App.jsx:
Add a state variable called "items", which is an array.
Add a state variable called "inputText", which is a string.

Save the text we input in that input tag in "inputText".

Add a button called "Add item". When pressed, it will add the text in "items".

Use items.map() in the App's render functionality, to render a card component for each item in the items.
Give each card component a "key" property
