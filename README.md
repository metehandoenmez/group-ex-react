# Getting started:
Fork, then clone this repository and run

    npm install

Inside the repository.

Run:

    npm run dev

This will start your react app.
React app will run on **localhost:3000**.

## Start editing the **src/app.jsx** file.

Move the CardComponent we created previously to a CardComponent.jsx file.
Import it in our App.jsx file.

Add an input tag in the CardComponent, after the first h3 tag.

Add an id property to the first h3 tag, called "titleH3".
Add an event listener to the Press Me button, which changes the text of the #titleH3 element to what we have in our input tag.
Add an id to the first div of the CardComponent.
Use a prop to set this id, called cardId.
Add another button called Delete Me to the card component. When we click it, we will delete the card. Use the prop id of the first div we created earlier.
Use .remove() on the html element.

Display this CardComponent three times, and delete every one of them each time.
